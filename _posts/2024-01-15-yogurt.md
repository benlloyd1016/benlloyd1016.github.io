For my first post in my self-study on Learning Basic Cheesemaking, I am dipping my toes into the world of cultured milk by making yogurt. I couldn't believe how easy it was to get started and am now making nearly a gallon of yogurt every week!

## Why make yogurt?

Every morning, one of my first activities is to scoop a giant spoonful of yogurt into my blender with a banana and some peanut butter: one of my favorite protein-packed breakfasts. I also enjoy yogurt mixed into spicy sauces, dolloped on top of chili, or drizzled with olive oil for a dip for flatbreads. It is creamy, tangy, and nutritious!

Between Rosalie and I, we having been eating three to four quarts of yogurt a week (you're welcome, Stonyfield!). Unfortunately, this means we generate just as many plastic tubs. One of the opportunities that makes me excited about making yogurt at home is that, paired with buying milk from a dairy that reuses the glass bottles, it eliminates a signficant chunk of our plastic waste.

## What is yogurt?

Yogurt is simply milk that has been transformed by friendly bacteria. When you add certain bacteria to milk, they eat the milk's sugars and produce acids (more technically, they convert lactose to lactic acid). These new acids react with the milk's proteins to cause the proteins to clump together, thickening the milk. The result is a tangy, thick milk that we call yogurt.

## Making yogurt

If you want to make yogurt, all you need is milk and the right kind of bacteria to add. This could be as easy as taking a store-bought yogurt labeled as having "live cultures", adding a spoonful to some milk, and waiting for the bacteria to do their thing!

Beyond that most basic method, there are several factors you can consider adjusting to improve the taste and texture of your yogurt:

#### Culture

There isn't just once species of bacteria that can be used to make yogurt. When you look at a container of yogurt from the store, there are usually several listed in the ingredients: *L. acidophilus*, *L. casei*, and *B. bifidum*, to name a few. They all behave a little differently and can change the taste and texture of the end result. There are also yeasts that can add their own flair to yogurt (such as those found in kefir) that add funky, bready aromas, and even some effervescence. Choosing your favorite cultures for your yogurt can tailor the end result to what tastes good to you.

#### Temperature

Different bacteria and yeasts are happiest at different temperatures. Some like it when it is room temperature, while others like it a little warmer. Choosing the right temperature for your cultures encourages them to multiply and work their yogurt-making magic. Generally, around 105-110 degrees F is a good target for yogurt (about the temperature of a baby's bathwater), and holding it for about 6-12 hours . Funky kefir flavors can emerge by leaving the yogurt to culture at room temperature, but in my experience so far, the yogurt doesn't become as thick. 

#### Denaturing the Whey Proteins

A third factor to control is the addition of a step to heat your milk to *denature the whey proteins*. This step is one of the biggest tricks to make a thick, scoopable yogurt.

When you heat milk, you denature its proteins, mainly whey proteins. Denaturing means these proteins unfold and change shape. Once your yogurt-making bacteria are added and begin producing lactic acid, the denatured proteins are even better than before at linking together and thickening the yogurt.

To denature the proteins in milk, many recipes call for heating the milk to 170-180 degrees F, and holding it for as short as a few moments and as long as 30-60 minutes. In the photos below, the yogurt on the left was made with heated milk, and the yogurt on the right was not.

After heating the milk, you allow it to cool before adding your cultures as you normally would.

## My yogurt making setup

All you need to make yogurt is milk, a culture, and a warm place. I have been culturing the yogurt in quart-size glass jars, although I have read of other people using plastic or stainless steel containers instead.

To keep my yogurt at the right temperature, I have been using an old insulated drink cooler, placing my yogurt jars inside, and filling it partially with warm water. I have found that it can hold my target 105-110 degree F temperature long enough to make yogurt. I keep a quickread thermometer inside to monitor the temperature during culturing. If you don't have a cooler, I have read of people leaving their jars in the oven with the light turned on or by culturing the yogurt in a slow cooker turned on low.

That's it! What I like about yogurt making is that most people can do it with things they already have at their house.

## Ben's Yogurt Recipe

The following is what I have been doing to make my yogurt. I am continually tweaking it to adjust subtle factors to my taste, but this captures what has been working for me lately.

</div>

Yield: About 3 quarts

Time: 6-12 hours

#### Ingredients
 - 1 gallon of milk
 - 3 tablespoons existing yogurt, either from the store (it must say Active Cultures on the label) or from a previous batch

#### Method
 1. **Denaturing step**. Heat the milk in a large pot on medium heat until a thermometer placed in the milk reaches 170 degrees F. Hold the temperature here (+/- a few degrees is no big deal), adjusting the heat on the stove as needed, and *stirring constantly*, for 30 minutes. Yes, 30 minutes of constant stirring. I didn't want this step to matter, but after experimenting with 8 different yogurt recipes, I have found that the yogurt becomes night-and-day thicker as a result of the heating. You need to stir the entire time because the milk will burn on the bottom of the pan and/or heat unevenly otherwise. Turn on a podcast, call a friend, practice mindfulness or lose yourself in the stirring - whatever works for you. After the 30 minutes is up (good job, you made it!), turn off the heat and allow the milk to cool to about 110 deg F.
 2. **Culturing**. To your milk, whisk in the existing yogurt starter. Pour the milk into your jars, cover them loosely with their lids, and place the jars in the warm place of your choosing. I use an insulated drink cooler with warm water, but you could also use a slow cooker turned to low, an oven with the light on, or any other creative method of holding the temperature around 105-110 degrees F for 6-12 hours.
 3. **Cooling**. After 6-12 hours of culturing, your milk should be transformed into thick, tangy yogurt. Magic! The yogurt will thicken further as it cools in the refrigerator, so I like to let it chill for a few hours before eating.

## Next steps

 Next in my cheesemaking study, I will be making a simple yogurt cheese, transforming my yogurt into a creamy, spreadable fresh cheese. More on that to come in a future post!

 Thanks for reading!
