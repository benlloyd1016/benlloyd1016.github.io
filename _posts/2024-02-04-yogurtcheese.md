Creamy, spreadable, and perfect on a slice of fresh bread with a dollop of tangy jam or a drizzle of honey, yogurt cheese (or "dream cheese" as David Asher appropriately calls it) feels like luxury but is so easy to make.

## What is a yogurt cheese?

A yogurt cheese is made by straining yogurt in a cheesecloth, allowing the liquidy whey to drain and leaving the thickened yogurt behind. Think about the difference between normal yogurt and "Greek yogurt", a yogurt that was strained in the very same way. A yogurt cheese simply extends the draining time until it becomes nearly like cream cheese.

## Sounds delcious. How do I make it?

I'm glad you asked. Here's the quick version: 1 quart of yogurt plus 1 teaspoon of salt, hung in a cheesecloth for a day, gives you 1 cup of yogurt cheese. For more details, see the recipe below.

Yield: About 1 cup of cheese

Time: 1 day

#### Ingredients
 - 1 quart of yogurt
 - 1/2 tsp salt (optional, but recommended)

#### Method
 1. **Straining**. Pour the yogurt into a cheesecloth-lined collander set over a bowl. You want the collander to sit high enough that it will not be sitting in the strained whey. Within a few seconds, you should start seeing the whey dripping from the cheesecloth. Cover the strainer to keep away the flies and allow this to sit on the counter for about 6 hours.
 2. **Hanging**. As the yogurt looses its whey, it will reduce in volume signficantly. After a few hours, it will be small enough to tie the cheesecloth up, tie it to a spoon, and suspend over a bowl above the whey. This can be tightened periodically by twisting the spoon to press even more whey out of the cheese.
 3. **Salting**. At about the one day mark, or when you find the cheese to be sufficiently firm for spreading, you can add the salt to the cheese and mix to combine. The salt adds flavor, helps to extract even more water from the cheese, and aids in preservation. Give it another 4 hours of hanging, and your cheese is ready to eat!

The cheese packs nicely into a 1 cup jar. I am not sure how long it will stay fresh in the fridge because we always eat it within the week!

For my next cheese in this series, I'll try out a class of cheeses with acid-formed curds by making paneer. Stay tuned!
