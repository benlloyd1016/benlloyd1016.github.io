A cheese you can grill, fry, and simmer in sauces, heat-acid cheeses such as paneer and queso fresco offer fun and unique culinary applications that no other cheese can.

Consisting of curds made by adding acid to boiling milk, heat-acid cheese is appropriately named. For the acid, common sources are yogurt, vinegar, or lemon juice.

## Why doesn't heat-acid cheese melt??

The resistance to melting is a result of the protein albumin that is found in milk. Typically with cultured dairy foods, this protein remains unaltered because it will only denature when the milk is exposed to acid at a high temperature. However, when it denatures, it stays that way, much like a cooked egg white stays firm and will not melt.

## How do you make a heat-acid cheese?

Paneer is one type of heat-acid cheese that presses the curds into a cake that can then be sliced for frying or simmering.

A basic method is provided below.

Yield: About 12 oz paneer

Time: About an hour

#### Ingredients
 - 1/2 gallon milk
 - 1/4 cup vinegar, 1/2 cup lemon juice, or 1 quart yogurt

#### Method
 1. **Heating**. Heat the milk in a pot until boiling.
 2. **Acid**. Remove the pot from heat. Add your acid, and give it a few gentle stirs, taking care to not break up the delicate durds. Wait about 5 minutes while the curds form.
 3. **Straining**. Strain the curds.
 4. **Pressing**. Press the curds. For my press, I used two old quart-size yogurt containers with holes drilled in one.Scoop the curds into the container with the holes and set the other container, filled with water for weight, on top. Wait until cool, then pop the paneer out of the strainer.

For my paneer, I fried it, then made a sauce of ginger, garlic, spinach, yogurt, lemon, and warm spices for it. This is something like a saag paneer. 

A fun Spring version might be to replace some of the spinach with ramp leaves and the garlic with ramp bulbs.
