<h1>Learning Basic Cheesemaking</h1>

<p>After learning about Welsh cheesemaking while researching my own Welsh heritage, I thought it would be fun to try out the art of crafting cheese myself!</p>

<p>I am loosely working through David Asher's <a href="https://www.theblacksheepschool.com/book-the-art-of-natural-cheesemaking" target="_blank">"The Art of Natural Cheesemaking"</a>, starting with simple yogurt cheeses and progressing to complex aged varieties.</p>

  {% for post in site.categories.cheese %}

  {% endfor %}
</ul>
