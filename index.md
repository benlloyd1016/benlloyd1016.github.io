## About me

Hi there! My name is Ben. Thanks for visiting my corner of the internet where I share what I am up to for my friends and family.

## What am I doing now?

*Last updated April 15th, 2024*

As the temperatures warm and the days grow longer, I am getting on my bike more and more to explore the web of quiet roads laid across the local ridges and valleys. Spring has invited out the wildflowers, and every day the woods grow greener. A robin has chosen the tree next to our porch swing for her nest and its three sky-blue eggs.

In the kitchen, I have been [making cheeses](/cheese.html)- mostly fresh, with a few blue cheeses aging in the fridge now. Adding flavors to yogurt cheeses has been fun (lemon and chive, orange and cardamom), and fresh mozzarella is next on the list. I have also been baking our breads and learning about new (to me) cuts of meat from our local butcher.

We bought our first house in 2023. In its 118th year, the house is full of quirks, most of them good! I am enjoying working with my hands on small projects around the house and yard.
