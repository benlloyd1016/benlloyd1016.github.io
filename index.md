# Ben Lloyd

## About me

Hi there! My name is Ben. I am a husband, son, brother, and more, based in Elkins, West Virginia.

## What am I doing now?

Starting the first of 2024, I will be diving into an [80 day self-study in natural cheesemaking](/cheese.html).

Winter has arrived to my area, and I take every opportunity to get up on a mountain for cross country skiing. When there isn't snow, I'm in my running shoes enjoying the quiet winter woods.

We bought our first house in 2023. In its 117 year, the house is full of quirks, most of them good! I am enjoying the opportunity to work with my hands on small projects around the house and yard.

I continue to provide civil engineering services on a variety of projects in the Upper Ohio Valley region.
